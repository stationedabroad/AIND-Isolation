    ----------
    game : `isolation.Board`

    Parameters
    ----------
    search_depth : int (optional)
        A strictly positive integer (i.e., 1, 2, 3,...) for the number of
        layers in the game tree to explore for fixed-depth search. (i.e., a
        depth of one (1) would only explore the immediate sucessors of the

    score_fn : callable (optional)
        A function to use for heuristic evaluation of game states.

    iterative : boolean (optional)
        Flag indicating whether to perform fixed-depth search (False) or
        iterative deepening search (True).

    method : {'minimax', 'alphabeta'} (optional)
        The name of the search method to use in get_move().

    timeout : float (optional)
        Time remaining (in milliseconds) when search is aborted. Should be a
        positive value large enough to allow the function to return before the
        timer expires.
